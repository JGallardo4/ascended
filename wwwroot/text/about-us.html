# About us #

&lt;Ascended&gt; was formed on Sargeras, Alliance side, during the Tomb of Sargeras raid. 
As a guild composed of many groups of long time friends and former guildmates, 
Ascended has strived to build on those friendships and forge new ones as well. 
Ascended has since been a semi-hardcore oriented progression guild which seeks 
to clear content at a decent pace and have a great time doing so. 
Through recruitment, leadership, and like-minded individuals we foster a culture of fair, 
kind, skilled, and determined players. As a guild we have continually improved ourselves 
and our progress throughout the subsequent raid tiers, even managing to 
sneak into Hall of Fame Alliance Eternal Palace rank 99/100:

* Antorus: US 241
* Mythic Uldir: US 197
* Mythic Dazarâ€™alor: US 130
* Mythic Eternal Palace: US 88

## Raid Schedule: ##
* Raids per week: 3 days on Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday 8:00-11:00PM CST
