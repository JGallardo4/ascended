	<p>
		&lt;Ascended&gt; was formed on Sargeras, Alliance side, during the Tomb of Sargeras raid. 
		
		As a guild composed of many groups of long time friends and former guildmates, 
		Ascended has strived to build on those friendships and forge new ones as well.
	</p>

	<p>
		Ascended has since been a semi-hardcore oriented progression guild which seeks 
		to clear content at a decent pace and have a great time doing so.
		
		Through recruitment, leadership, and like-minded individuals we foster a culture of fair, 
		kind, skilled, and determined players.
	</p>
		
	<p>		
		As a guild we have continually improved ourselves 
		and our progress throughout the subsequent raid tiers, even managing to 
		sneak into Hall of Fame Alliance Eternal Palace rank 99/100:
